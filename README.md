# INFOMDDS - Dashboard
The current dashboard is an interim build, and is a work in progress

## Running the App
To run the dashboard make sure you have a valid docker installation on machine. Run "docker compose up" in the root directory of the dashboard where the docker-compose.yml file is located (eg. in DSS_Dashboard/)

## Data Collection and Preparation
    Data collection and preparation is done within each file under "st_pages" for the plots generated in those files. 

    emissions.py
    Data collection and preparation of total electric energy consumption per European country in 2023 and generated bar chart to visualise it.

    EV_Prices_DE.py
    Plots on EV prices and its relation to various factors in Germany.

    EVInfastructure.py
    Plots on EV charging stations per country.

    EVSales.py
    Data preparation on EV sales per country. Plots on number of new EV passenger cars sold per year per country.

    green_energy.py
    Work in progress

## Data Sources
    1. Vector data for plots on charging infrastructure - geodata
    2. Properties of Electric Vehicles - EV_cars.csv
    3. Properties of EV recharging stations infrastructure per country - cleaned - cleaned_NoC_data.csv
    4. New passenger car sales (EV) in Europe - cleaned_NoEVS_data.csv
    5. Energy consumption per country - reduced_energyc1.csv
    6. Scraped data on recharging infrastructure - not cleaned - scraped_NoC_data.csv

## Existing Indicators and Visualizations
    1. Number of Charging Stations
        Number of recharging points to Power per station, by country. Map of Europe showing total recharging power output by country. 
        Generated by EVInfastructure.py
    2. EV sales
        New passenger EV car sales in the EU over the years 2014 - 2023.
        Generated by EVSales.py
    3. EV prices
        Price range of EV in relation to several related properties of EVs for Germany.
        Generated by EV_Prices_DE.py
    4. Fossil fuel emissions by cars
        Total electric energy consumption compared between countries, as well as total electric energy consumption per country over several years.
        Generated by emissions.py
    5. Green energy usage
        We are working on plots showing emissions per country per year and EV sales trends over these years. This is still a work in progress; the title might be subject to change if appropriate.
        Current state of this part of the project can be found in the notebook EV_em_and_sale.ipynb
